### Instructions
- Assemble each of the PCB kits SEPARATELY by ![Adafruit's instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/game-of-life). Ensure that all elements are as flush to the PCB as possible. If you are good at soldering and want a clean finish, mount all the LEDs on one side and all the other components on the reverse side.

- Place the PCB on the inner grooves of one of the *base* pieces

Use inch long flexible wire to join the panels along the N-S direction. This will give you flexibility in mounting the panels
- All parts were glued together with superglue and an accelerant for each part of the glue up.
- Match the slotted side panel and slotted arm of one of the bases to pass-through the USB cable
